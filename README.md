## Overview
This is the official implementation of 'Creating a Lens of Chinese Culture: A Multimodal Dataset for Chinese Pun Rebus Art Understanding.' In this repo, we provide the code to reproduce the results we listed in the paper. It is worth noting that the code here is only an example of how to leverage the Pun Rebus Dataset to evaluate the ability of LVMs. We encourage the readers to build or design more tailored evaluators based on the provided basic usages.

This repo contains:
* Download link for the artwork images inside the Pun Rebus Art Dataset.
* Ground Truth information for the Pun Rebus Art Dataset.
* Scorer for the three basic tasks.
* Baseline evaluation code with GPT-4, Gemini, Claude 3, and Qwen-VL model families.
