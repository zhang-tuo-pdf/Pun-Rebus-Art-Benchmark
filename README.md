## Overview
This is the official implementation of 'Creating a Lens of Chinese Culture: A Multimodal Dataset for Chinese Pun Rebus Art Understanding.' In this repo, we provide the code to reproduce the results we listed in the paper. It is worth noting that the code here is only an example of how to leverage the Pun Rebus Dataset to evaluate the ability of LVMs. We encourage the readers to build or design more tailored evaluators based on the provided basic usages.
